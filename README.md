This program emulates a basic command shell. It takes in user input and runs any valid commands that the user enters. The commands can also be chained using tokens ||, &&, ;. The shell also runs up until the user enters exit. The known bugs that we encountered is that chaining the chaining of commands doesn't always produce the desired output. Another known bug is that the program at times does not exit when exit is entered for the first time.
