This assignment was a similar structure to implementing the test command. We utilized a similar parse feature to finding test and we utilized the environment variables to change the directory. After extensive testing, we were not able to find any bugs in our program that handled the cd command. However, there is still the known bug where we have multiple closing parentheses which results in the wrong output. All features in the specifications were implemented correctly and we have included a cd_test file to run some tests of our progam.
