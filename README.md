After many late nights Assignment 3 tests very well. We were able to implement both the test commands and precedenceâ€™s as well as fix our issues with the prior assignment 2. We have included the test cases as listed in the specs. As far as know bugs after a lot of testing, when you start a command line with an opening parenthesis and end the whole command with that matching closed parenthesis it does not seem to work. For example (echo A && ([ main.cpp ] && echo CD )) && exit), it will not account for the last child exit.
